                <h2 class="template4 h2alooma" style="margin-left: 400px;">Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">How do I choose the right size? What if I get it wrong?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Think of it less as a technical choice and more as matching the tool to the task. Our 10-yard is for purging a room or two. Our 20-yard is for a major renovation. Our larger sizes are for starting over. Our team is skilled at listening to your story and helping you choose the right canvas for your project.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">What does it mean to fill a dumpster responsibly?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Every act of clearing should be done with intention. While our dumpsters can handle most materials from your home or construction site, hazardous materials like chemicals, paint, and tires must be handled separately. This is an important part of clearing the way responsibly, and we can guide you on how to dispose of these items properly.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">How long is the rental period? What if my project takes longer?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Our standard rental period is designed to give you ample time for your project. But we know that transformation doesn't always stick to a schedule. If your work requires more time, just let us know. We offer flexible extensions to ensure you have the tool you need for as long as you need it.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Will the dumpster damage my property?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">We believe in leaving a space better than we found it. Our drivers are professionals who are trained to place your roll off dumpster with care and precision. We use protective measures to ensure your driveway is treated with the same respect as your project.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">What is the first step? How does the process begin?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">The journey begins with a simple conversation. You call us and tell us your story—what you’re trying to clear, what you’re trying to build. We’ll listen, recommend the right tool, and schedule a time to bring you your blank slate.</p>
                <h4 class="template4 palooma">Do I have to be there when you deliver it?
                </h4>
                <p style="font-family: Verdana, Geneva, Tahoma, sans-serif;">Not necessarily. As long as we have clear instructions on where you want the dumpster placed and the area is accessible, you can continue with your day. Our goal is to make this part of your process as seamless as possible.</p>
